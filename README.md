# set-the-table

I decided to create a small app that mimicked a code challenge that I did recently. 
The idea is to be able to enter the number of fruits that each person would like, then "set the table" with 
by clicking a button. I wrote a quick blog post about it that you can read at http://www.emorygriffith.com/code-challenge-set-the-table/ 

The project is live here: http://emorygriffith.github.io/set-the-table/
